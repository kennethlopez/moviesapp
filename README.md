## Architecture

The architecture of this app is based on the [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–presenter) (Model View Presenter) pattern

#### How to implement a new screen following MVP

Imagine you have to implement a sign in screen.

1. Create a new package under `ui` called `signin`
2. Create a new Activity called `SignInActivity` class that extends `BaseActivity`. You could also use a Fragment
3. Define the view and presenter interfaces that your Activity/Fragment and Presenter is going to implement. Create a new interface called `SignInContract`, inside create another interface called `View` that extends `BaseView` and another one called `Presenter` that extends `BasePresenter<View>`. Add the methods that you think will be necessary on both interfaces, e.g. `showSignInSuccessful()` for the `View` and `signIn(String email)` for the `Presenter`.
    Code should look like this:

    ```java
    interface SignInContract {
        interface View extends BaseView {
            void showSignInSuccessful();
        }

        interface Presenter extends BasePresenter<View> {
            void signIn(String email);
        }
    }
    ```
4. Create a `SignInPresenter` class that extends `BasePresenter<SignInContract.View>` and implements `SignInContract.Presenter`
5. Implement the methods in `SignInPresenter` that your Activity requires to perform the necessary actions, e.g. `signIn(String email)`. Once the sign in action finishes you should call `getView().showSignInSuccessful()`
6. Make your `SignInActivity` implement `SignInContract.View` and implement the required methods like `showSignInSuccessful()`
7. In your activity, inject a new instance of `SignInPresenter` and call `super.attachPresenter(presenter, this)` from `onCreate`. This will allow your presenter to have an instance of your activity and it would also let your Presenter have a lifecycle awareness, this way you can override `onStart`, `onResume`, `onPause`, `onStop` and `onDestroy` methods on your Presenter. Also, set up a click listener in your button that calls `presenter.signIn(email)`
